# Market API 

## Description
This is a project to put into practice my knowledge in java using a good framework as spring is, 
and I decided to create a small database and check how java works and what are its advantages and disadvantages. IÂ´m really surprised because 
it's amazing all you can do with this framework. It's a small APi where you can create and list products it's easy, but I have the curiosity.

## Installation
You don't need to install anything because of used docker you only need run the next command and clone the repo:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

and next you only run:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

This creates the database, and you can begin to use the api.

## How to use
It's so easy to use, you can use postman or another tool, but the project uses swagger to document the API and you don't have to see the database every time and see the types.
